### Description
With the increasing user demand for interface personalization, products that support customization are becoming more and more popular. Those products that do not support user customization are always mocked by users for their "poison spots" in the layout; At the same time, we also noticed that the old TAB page of the browser has only the most basic functions in terms of the content that the user really needs, and can not fully meet the daily use needs of the majority of users; At the same time, it adds many additional functions that users do not need, which cannot provide users with a better experience. Therefore, we decided to develop a new browser TAB plug-in that supports user customization, replacing the old browser TAB.
